# Story Point ðŸ¤·

**Realtime voting (the story points) app.**

Oh! The sweating part of agile. This app just allows you to not get biased by others saying this worth less than 1 point. Just vote your point and see the result after the timer.

## Get started ðŸš€

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ananto30/story-point.git
cd story-point
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*

### Run the app along with server

### App
Install the dependencies...
```bash
cd app
npm install
```
Build the app...
```bash
npm run build
```

### Server
Install the dependencies...
```bash
cd server
npm install
```
Start the server...
```bash
npm start
```

## Development tricks ðŸ§™

The app can be run with - 
```bash
cd app
npm run dev
```
And the server can be run and serve the index.html file
```bash
cd server
npm start
```
The rollup will build the js file in realtime and our server can serve that with realtime changes.

## Docker ðŸš¢
```bash
docker build -t story-point .
docker run --name story-point -p 3000:3000 -d story-point
```
